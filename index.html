        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chosen is the first-ever-multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus. Created outside of the Hollywood system, The Chosen allows us to see Him through the eyes of those who knew him. No matter where you are at in your journey with Jesus Christ, this TV show is for you.
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100% Crowd Funded Project.
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This show is incredible.  I literally had to build this tribute page in an effort to express just how awesome I think the show is.
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an in-depth look into the lives of the first followers of Christ and how their individual encounters with the divine impacted their lives, watch this breath taking glimpse into history.  Watch as the new testament comes alive and brand new in this multi-season show.
